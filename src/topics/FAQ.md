LLDB only

### Does the plugin use VLS?

The pluginâ€™s language analysis is implemented from scratch, leveraging the IntelliJ Platform infrastructure for
incremental analysis and indexing.

### Is debugging available?

Yes, you can debug your V code in CLion, IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, PyCharm Professional, GoLand, and Rider. See the
section on [Debugging](Debugging.md) for details.

### Any tips for migrating from Emacs, Vim, or VS Code?

To bring some of the Emacs keybindings into the IDE, go to **Settings / Preferences | Keymap** and enable the Emacs
keymap.
If you are used to M-x, consider remapping the **Find Action** binding to this shortcut in the Keymap settings. For more
Emacs extensions, try the
[Emacs+Patched](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10045-emacs-patched)
plugin.

To get Vim emulation, use the
[IdeaVim](https://github.com/JetBrains/ideavim)
plugin. It adds motion keys, marks, registers, and visual mode commands.
Similarly, you can try out the
[VS Code Keymap](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12062-vscode-keymap)
plugin.
