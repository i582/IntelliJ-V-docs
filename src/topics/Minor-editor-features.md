[//]: # (title: Minor editor features)

IntelliJ V adds a lot of minor convenience features that make it easier to work with code.

## Foldings

The plugin provides a wide opportunity for code folding. You can fold most constructions with several lines of code:

## Code commenting

Using the shortcut <kbd>Ctrl + /</kbd> you can comment out the current line or selection with inline comments. Shortcut <kbd>Ctrl + Shift + /</kbd> will comment out the selected fragment with block comment.

## Code vision for VCS

Above functions, structures, interfaces, and so on, you can see information about those who edited the code.

## Exit points

The plugin highlights all function exit points (`panic` and `exit` calls as well) when you position the caret at one of them or on the function name.
