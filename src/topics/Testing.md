Use one the following options to start tests:

- Click the gutter icon next to the test entry:

  ![](run-gutter.png){width=700 border-effect="line"}

  You can run tests from one file or from the entire module using the icon next to the function or next to the module
  name, respectively.
- Use the context menu in Project view (for a module or the whole project):

  ![](run-context-menu-in-project-view.png){width=700 border-effect="line"}
